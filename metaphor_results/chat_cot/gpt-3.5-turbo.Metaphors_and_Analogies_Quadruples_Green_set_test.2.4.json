The meaning could be interpreted as movies are constantly present on screens and are inseparable from them, like how metal rusts when exposed to air.\n\n2) This sentence is also using a metaphor to compare how movies and screens interact in a similar way to how lightning and the sky are connected. The meaning could be interpreted as movies are a dynamic element that adds excitement to screens, like how lightning adds drama to the sky.\n\n3) This sentence is using a simile to compare movies' relationship to screens to a gameshow's relationship to television.
