The pen is to pig as hay is to horse.\n \nThe literal sentence is: \"pen is to pig what reservoir is to water.\" This sentence uses a direct comparison rather than a figurative one. It is saying that the pen is necessary for keeping the pig contained and safe, just as a reservoir is necessary for holding water.\n\nThe anomalous sentence is: \"pen is to pig what coop is to chicken.\" This sentence is unusual because it does not make sense in terms of the usual relationship between a pen and a pig or a coop and a chicken. Pigs are usually raised in pens, whereas chickens are raised in coops. So this sentence does not fit the usual pattern of comparison between those objects."}, {"input": "I will give you three sentences and I would like you to tell me which one is anomalous, which one is literal, and which one is a metaphor.
