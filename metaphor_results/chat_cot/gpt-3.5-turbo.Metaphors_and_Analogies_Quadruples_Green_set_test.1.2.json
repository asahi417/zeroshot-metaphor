It may be implying that saxophone is integral to jazz in the same way that a document is necessary for a copier to function, but this is not a clear or intuitive comparison. \n\nOption 3 is also difficult to interpret because it is comparing saxophone to jazz and typewriter to poetry, which are not directly related. It may be suggesting that saxophone is a tool for creating jazz music like a typewriter is for writing poetry, but again, this is not a straightforward or obvious comparison. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 2."}, {"input": "Answer the question by choosing the correct option.\nWhich of the following is difficult to interpret?\n1) sugar is to coffee what honey is to tea\n2) sugar is to coffee what incentive is to deal\n3) sugar is to coffee what grinder is to bean\nLet's think step by step.", "output": "The correct option is 2) sugar is to coffee what incentive is to deal. This comparison is more abstract and requires a deeper understanding of the relationship between sugar and coffee, as well as between incentive and deal. The other options have more straightforward and concrete comparisons."}, {"input": "Answer the question by choosing the correct option.\nWhich of the following is difficult to interpret?\n1) thermometer is to temperature what polygraph is to honesty\n2) thermometer is to temperature what table is to leg\n3) thermometer is to temperature what barometer is to pressure\nLet's think step by step.", "output": "3) thermometer is to temperature what barometer is to pressure."}, {"input": "Answer the question by choosing the correct option.\nWhich of the following is difficult to interpret?\n1) train is to track what conductor is to whistle\n2) train is to track what signal is to wire\n3) train is to track what trolley is to rail\nLet's think step by step.", "output": "Option 1 and 3 both contain pairs of words that make logical sense (train is on a track and conductor blows a whistle, trolley runs on a rail).

The structure is \"A is to B what C is to D.\"\n\nStep 2: Determine the relationship between the first two words (A and B). Watermelon is a fruit that has a rind (a tough outer layer).\n\nStep 3: Find a word that has a similar relationship with the word in the third position (C). The options are peel, bush, and butt.\n\nStep 4: Determine the relationship between the third and fourth word (C and D). The word in the third position (C) is something that is removed or discarded from the fourth word (D).\n\nStep 5: Choose the option that best fits the above criteria. Option 1 and 2 have a clear relationship between the first two words and the third and fourth words. However, option 3 (watermelon is to rind what cigarette is to butt) is difficult to interpret because the relationship between a watermelon and its rind is not equivalent to the relationship between a cigarette and its butt. Therefore, option 3 is the correct answer."}]}
