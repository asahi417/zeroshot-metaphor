The literal sentence is describing something in a straightforward manner without any figurative language. Therefore, we can deduce that sentence 2 (\"This wood is a sculpture\") is the literal sentence as it is stating that the wood is a sculpture, which can be taken at face value.\n\nNext, let's identify the metaphor. A metaphor is a figure of speech in which a word or phrase is applied to something to which it is not literally applicable. In sentence 1 (\"Her hairdo is a sculpture\"), the hairdo is being compared to a sculpture, which is not its literal meaning, therefore it is the metaphor.\n\nLastly, the anomalous sentence is the sentence that stands out because it does not fit with the other two sentences. Sentence 3 (\"A sheet is a sculpture\") does not have the same level of figurative language as sentence 1, but also does not make sense literally like sentence 2.

It suggests that the decision is powerful, impactful, and potentially dangerous.\n\nThe anomalous sentence is: \"Dust is a bullet.\" This sentence is anomalous because there is no clear comparison between dust (a non-physical, non-threatening substance) and a bullet (a physical, potentially deadly object) that makes sense in a literal or metaphorical sense."}, {"input": "I will give you three sentences and I would like you to tell me which one is anomalous, which one is literal, and which one is a metaphor.
