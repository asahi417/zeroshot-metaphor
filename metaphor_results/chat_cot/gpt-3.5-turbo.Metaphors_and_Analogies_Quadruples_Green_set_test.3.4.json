It implies that a pen is a containment area for pigs in the same way that a coop is for chickens. \n\n2) Literal: This sentence is a factual statement that compares the function of a pen to a pig with the function of a reservoir to water. Both are containment areas, where one holds pigs and the other holds water. \n\n3) Anomalous: This sentence is an anomalous sentence, as it does not follow the expected pattern of the other two sentences. It does not compare the function or relationship between a pen and a pig to something else, but instead compares the pen and pig to the relationship between hay and a horse.
